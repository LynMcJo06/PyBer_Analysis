# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 PyBer with Matplotlib
In this module, I will be creating visualization of rideshare data for PyBer.  The goal is to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neightborhoods.  I will be using the Python graphing library called Matplotlib.  Our CEO is V. Isualize and my supervisor is Omar.  
## Lesson 1
I learned how to create line, bar, scatter, bubble and pie charts using both the MATLAB and Object-Oriented Approach OOP).  After completing the skill drill for the OOP, the documentation asked us which chart I thought was best for graphing the ride-sharing data.  I feel the horizontal bar best depicts the data; I find it the easiest to read and interpret in a short amount of time.
