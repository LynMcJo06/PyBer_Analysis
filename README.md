# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 PyBer with Matplotlib
In this module, I will be creating visualization of rideshare data for PyBer.  The goal is to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neightborhoods.  I will be using the Python graphing library called Matplotlib.  Our CEO is V. Isualize and my supervisor is Omar.  
## Lesson 1
I learned how to create line, bar, scatter, bubble and pie charts using both the MATLAB and Object-Oriented Approach OOP).  After completing the skill drill for the OOP, the documentation asked us which chart I thought was best for graphing the ride-sharing data.  I feel the horizontal bar best depicts the data; I find it the easiest to read and interpret in a short amount of time.  At the end of the lesson, I learned how to add error bars to line and bar charts, change major tick marks, and add minor tick marks.  In the last exercise, I created graphs for a small dataset.  I did fine until the final skill drill and I could not get error bars added to the bar chart.  I checked the instructor's speed run video and he too could not get the error bars on the chart.  He moved on and so did I.  I should mention that I made several attempts to add the error bars and spent approximately two hours on the skill drill.  
## Lesson 2
I imported and inspected two CSV files and converted them to dataframes.  After verifying that each dataframe looked good and did not have any missing data or need additional cleaning, I merged the two dataframs into one dataframe.
